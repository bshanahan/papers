# Shanahan, Bold, Dudson JPP 2024
This repo includes the input file for the simulations in Shanahan et al., JPP 2024. The grid file was obtained using [zoidberg](https://github.com/boutproject/zoidberg) with the coefficients for the Dommaschk potentials kindly supplied by Ant√≥nio Coelho via private communication. The Hermes-i model is found at https://github.com/dschwoerer/hermes-2, commit [37e0459](https://github.com/dschwoerer/hermes-2/commit/37e045925378e20447457f5e911e4a4d926d34a9).  The model was compiled with [BOUT++ v5.0.0](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev).
